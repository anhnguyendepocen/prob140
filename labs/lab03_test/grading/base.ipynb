    "In probability theory we often assume that a \"well shuffled standard deck\" is one in which all 52! permutations of the cards are equally likely. But how to actually achieve this \"well shuffled\" state with a physical deck?\n",
    "\n",
    "Partly, the answer depends on the method of shuffling. In this lab, you will study one kind of shuffle, called the *riffle shuffle* (see roughly 0:25-0:30 of this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcH7zpd5viM)). Your goal will be to see how many times you have to riffle shuffle a standard deck so that the cards get \"all mixed up\".\n",

    "Disclaimer: 52! factorial is a large number, and you won't be getting close to simulating the uniform distribution on that many possible outcomes. You'll do something much more tractable that still allows you to get a sense of the randomness in repeated riffle shuffling."
