    "# Lab 12: Chinese Restaurant Process, Part I #\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Chinese Restuarant Process* is a discrete time stochastic process that can be used as a model for clustering. The model does not assume a fixed number of clusters. Instead, the clusters evolve randomly as individuals enter, according to a specified probabilistic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have distributed the analysis of this process across two labs so that you can reasonably complete them and have time to think about the ideas without feeling rushed. In the two labs you will study:\n",
    "- the distribution of the random number of clusters\n",
    "- the \"rich get richer\" nature of the clustering, and the long run behavior of the fraction of individuals in the first cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "In both labs, part of the analysis will be by simulation and part by probability calculations. The calculations of probabilities and expectations in the first lab are involve only discrete distributions. The second lab will contain long run analysis involving beta distributions and some of the beta-binomial calculations seen in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we describe the process, here is some history. The process has its origins in the work of [Warren Ewens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Ewens) in the early 1970's, in particular the [Ewens Sampling Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewens%27s_sampling_formula) of population genetics. Since then, the development of the theory of the stochastic process and its use in machine learning has been very much a Berkeley enterprise: Jim Pitman, David Aldous, and Mike Jordan are among the people involved. The restaurant analogy is due to Jim Pitman and our late colleague Lester Dubins, during one of their regular cafe meetings decades ago. Though there is a popular story that they came up with it while eating at a Chinese restaurant, in fact they were at the cafe Strada, which you will recognize as the cafe you see when you come out of the building after Prob140 class.

    "### The Process ###\n",
    "In keeping with the Chinese Restaurant analogy, think of clusters as groups of people sitting at the same table. We will only consider occupied tables, so the number of tables is equal to the number of clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process evolves according to the following rules.\n",
    "- There is a positive parameter $\\theta$.\n",
    "- People enter the restaurant one at a time.\n",
    "- Person 1 enters and sits at a table which we will call Table 1.\n",
    "- Each subsequent person \n",
    "    - either joins an existing table with probability proportional to the number of people already at that table, or\n",
    "    - starts a new table with probability proportional to $\\theta$.\n",
    "- People choose tables independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about running out of room. The restaurant has infinite capacity and each table is infinitely large. You can imagine infinitely many such tables at the start, or imagine new tables appearing magically each time a person's random choice is to start a new table. We prefer the second image because it consists only of the occupied tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the tables are not numbered at the start. We number them according to their order of formation. Thus Table 1 is the table at which Person 1 sits. Table 2 is the next new table to be formed. We can't say exactly who starts it, because that's random. Table 3 is the third new table to be formed. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Parts 1 and 2 below, you will write code to simulate the Chinese Restaurant process. In Parts 3 through 5 you will study the distribution of the total number of occupied tables after $N$ people have been seated. In other words, you will study the distribution of the number of clusters produced by this process when it has run for $N$ steps.\n",
