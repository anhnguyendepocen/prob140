    "### Sampling without Replacement ###\n",

    "When you sample in this way, information about how the first few draws came out affects the conditional chances of how the other draws will come out â€“ the draws are not independent of each other. However, many remarkable symmetries arise in the distributions of simple random samples. Understanding these is a key to simplifying calculations and gaining insight."
