    "### Detailed Balance ###\n",
    "The Markov Chains that we have been studying have stationary distributions that contain much information about the behavior of the chain. The stationary distribution of a chain is a probability distribution that solves the balance equations. For some chains it is easy to identify a distribution that solves the balance equations. But for other chains, the solution can be complicated or tedious. Let's see if we can find a simple way to solve the balance equations.\n",

    "Recall our earlier image of what is being balanced in the equations. Imagine a large number of independent replications of the chain. For example, suppose a large number of particles are moving among the states according to the transition probabilities of the chain, all moving at instants 1, 2, 3, $\\ldots$ independently of each other.\n",

    "\n",
    "The state space is the integers 0 through $N$. Recall how the transitions work: at each step, the chain either goes up by 1, stays the same, or goes down by 1. Such chains are called *birth and death* chains and are used to model many different random quantities such as gamblers' fortunes or population sizes. In our example, we are modeling the size of the population of gas particles in a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "For such chains, most of the transition probabilities are 0 because in one step the chain can only move to the two neighboring states. So most of the detailed balance equations are trivially true. For the ones the involve positive tranistion probabilities, the states $i$ and $j$ have to be separated by 1 (remember that the detailed balance equations specify $i \\ne j$). And in that case both $P(i, j)$ and $P(j, i)$ are positive, as the chain is irreducible.\n",
