    "### Markov Chain Monte Carlo ###\n",
    "The goal of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is to generate samples from a complicated high dimensional distributions about which we have incomplete information. For example, it might be that we don't know the normalizing constant, as we saw in the code breaking example of the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the distribution from which we want to generate a sample is called $\\pi$. We are going to assume that $\\pi$ is a probability distribution on a finite set, and you should imagine the set to be large. MCMC relies on a few observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $X_0, X_1, \\ldots $ be an irreducible aperiodic Markov Chain on a finite state space. Then the distribution of $X_n$ converges to a stationary distribution as $n$ gets large. If we can create a Markov Chain $\\{X_n\\}$ that has the desired distribution $\\pi$ as its stationary distribution, then we can simulate draws from $\\pi$ (or close enough to it) by running the chain for a long time and using the values $X_n$ for large $n$.\n",

You could start with something as simple as, \"Wherever the chain is, it picks the next value uniformly at random from among all the states.\" For a pair of states $i$ and $j$, the transition probability $Q(i, j)$ is called the *proposal probability*.\n",
